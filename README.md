3. Receive responses generated by an LLM model, integrated through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced accuracy.

## Features

- **AI Chat Interface**: A user-friendly chat interface in Streamlit for PDF-based Q&A.
- **LLM Integration**: Connects to Gemini or Hugging Face API to process user queries.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines document retrieval and AI content generation.
- **Flask API**: Provides REST endpoints for PDF uploads and queries.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes unit tests for robust and accurate functionality.
